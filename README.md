### Hi I'm Jüri! 👋

I am an Android developer living in Boston, Massachusetts. 🍀

I've been in the industry for over 3 years 🎂

I fell in love with video game design when I was younger, which has fruited into a passion for Android development 📱

You can often find me tinkering with various ideas in the android, web, and game space. 🔧
